  Maintainerr is an automated media management tool that helps keep your Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby libraries clean and organized.


  It automatically monitors your media server's watch history and can remove content based on customizable rules, helping you save precious storage space.
  Maintainerr integrates seamlessly with your existing media server and can be configured to maintain your libraries exactly how you want them.


  🛠️ SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS

  During initial setup, you'll need to connect Maintainerr to your media server (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby) and configure your desired retention rules.
  The application will then automatically manage your media based on these settings.
